#### Description:
This is an app that allows users to register for small sided football games. Users can use the create option to create a game. The play option will then return a list of games that other players have created and they can register for. If they click on the game it takes them to a link where they can see the other players playing and post on a message board. Finally, if they go to games they can see a list of games they're playing in and a list of past games they've yet to play in.
